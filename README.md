BBPS Ticketing & Fulfilment Prototype:

**Demo**: https://resplendent-liger-43f73c.netlify.app

This project reimagines Bharat Connect (BC) as a one-stop ecosystem for high-frequency spends. 
Enabling users to book monument entry slots, movie tickets, and metro recharges directly via any BBPS-enabled COU app (GPay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc.).

**Why This Matters**
Brings cultural, mobility, and entertainment services into the BBPS fold — from Taj Mahal bookings to Bengaluru Metro recharges.
Competes with platforms like BookMyShow and District by Zomato by offering the same fulfillment at a fraction of the convenience fee (CCF).
No more queues: Users can book timed monument entry in advance, get digital QR access, and pay via trusted apps.

**As a PM**
Conceiving this project was both strategic and deeply fulfilling: Merging India Stack infrastructure with real-world travel and cultural access. 
It’s a showcase of how public payment rails can drive inclusion, reduce dependency on closed aggregators, and build the future of digital Bharat.
